# Alexis Tucker
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer major that just graduated Dec 17, 2022!<br><br>
Currently, working on a research project around machine learning continuous integration pipelines.<br><br>

Before entering engineering school, by running my college newspaper, I grew a passion for reshaping experiences to be more serviceable to people. I'm always thinking of ways how my projects can be better for people whether based on efficiency or function. While I'm not working on my projects, I'm painting, hiking, and writing.
