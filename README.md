# Alexis Tucker
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer major that just graduated Dec 17, 2022!<br><br>
Currently, working on a research project around machine learning CI/CD pipelines.<br><br>

Before entering engineering school, by running my college newspaper, I grew a passion for reshaping experiences to be more serviceable to people. I'm always thinking of ways how my projects can be better for people whether based on efficiency or function. I was a part of a team developing a VR soccer with wheelchairs game in Unreal Engine to help expand the University of Michiganâ€™s game design program. They are seeking to include VR development within the program, and our team's project acted as a trial for how that could be implemented. Another goal within our project was to provide some representation for disabilities that is lacking amongst the gaming industry. Within another project, my team and myself created a simple version of Canvas that is more student-focused and oriented fpr University students. Check out my repos!
While I'm not working on my projects, I'm painting, hiking, and writing.
